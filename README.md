# Oscilloscope-channel-extension
An oscilloscope display channel expander that can display four channels signals (analog signal, digital signal) at the same time with ordinary dual trace oscilloscope.

# Basic requirements
(1) oscilloscope can display four low-frequency (Hz ~ KHz) analog signals, and the signal VPP is less than 5V;

(2) the expander only needs a single dc power supply;

(3) with self-check function (74161 is used to generate four digital signals as the circuit under test)
